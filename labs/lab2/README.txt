Before you start, I highly suggest you go through the documents in the directory of `deliberative_agent_description` quickly. 
1. `deliberative_presentation_ta.pdf`: the slides we use for project description. 
2. `deliberative_doc.pdf`: more description about the deliberative agent. 
3. `LogistPlatform_18pages.pdf`: an overview of the platform we use. It helps better in all these four exercises.
